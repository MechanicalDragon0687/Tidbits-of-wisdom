first you must find the nsuid for the app. often times this can be done using the game's eshop page on the nintendo website or by using a CDN database 

lets use Netflix for example. i am going to do this the hard way (the easy way is to pull it up in a database). 
i open the netflix page on eshop. https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-3ds
at the top i see a "free download" link. this will attempt to "purchase" this free app using my account, i will copy this link:
https://ec.nintendo.com/title_purchase_confirm?title=50010000007057
see the title there? that isnt a title id, that is a nsuid.

i can create a URL for eshop by adding ESHOP:// (case sensitive) to the beginning: ESHOP://50010000007057

now i can use any QR code generator to make a qr code for that url to be able to use it to go to the eshop page.

note
if using a cdn database, you might see the line <nsuid>50010000007057</nsuid> (if xml) or it would be listed similarly in json. 
that makes finding the nsuid a bit easier.
